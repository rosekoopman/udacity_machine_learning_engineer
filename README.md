# Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

This repository contains my work for the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/aws-machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd189) offered by Udacity. Three projects are included:

- project 1: Build a sentiment detection model for movies using RNNs and deploy the model using AWS services to make the model available to end users.

- project 2: Train a plagiarism detection model an deploy the model using AWS Sagemaker.

- project 3: Build a predictive model which predicts either water and/or flow for several water bodies maintained by the Acea Group.
